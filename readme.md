Pitchify for Seesmic Desktop
===================================================

_From [Pitchify.com](http://pitchify.com)_:
>Pitchify collects reviews from the two excellent webzines [Pitchfork](http://www.pitchfork.com) and [Drowned In Sound](http://drownedinsound.com/) on a daily basis, 
then checks if the reviewed albums are available on Spotify. Only albums that have received a rating of 8 or more (out of 10) will be included on Pitchify. 
Lots of albums are reviewed every day, and thousands of tracks added to Spotify every week. Pitchify tries to sort through the pile, throw away the Gagas and the 
Nickelbacks and present you with the very best that Spotify has to offer.

This plugin collects the feed from Pitchify and displays the albums inline in Seesmic Desktop 2. Please install from the Seesmic Marketplace
